Weatherpy Observations:

1.	After looking at the max temp vs lat data, you find the higher max temperatures actually skew towards
a positive latitude and are not centered around the equator.  Of course, this probably serves as evidence for
an axial tilt of the Earth which explains seasonal temperature patterns (This data is for August and it's summer in
the positive latitude ranges)

2.	There is some interesting variablility in humidity. The places with the higher variability of humidity 
on the planet seems to be centered somewhere near the tropics (~24/-24 degrees) where the equator and outer ranges 
tend to have less variability.  This could also be an error generated from smaller numbers of samples on the latitudinal
fringes.

3.	It's hard to discern any easily detictable patterns from cloudiness and windspeed.  This would suggest that
perhaps latitude has less direct effect on these and it may be useful to compare, let's say windspeed, with latitudinal
different from the day's jetstream location, etc.
